						<p>After so much austerity, I have understood this as the real truth, <b>God is present in every Jiva, there is no other God besides that. Who serves Jiva, serves God indeed.</b></p>
						<p><b>Swami Vivekananda</b> had a desire to start a Math for the dedicated women just like Belur Math, to run on the similar lines and the similar Motto, Salvation of the self and Welfare of the world – <b>‘AtmanoMoksharthumJagatHitaya Cha’</b>. Swamiji also strongly felt that the said women’s Math should be managed independently by women. <br><br>In December 1954, the year of Holy Mother’s birth centenary, Sri Sarada Math was established as a Monastic Order of Sannyasinis by the authorities of the Belur Math, thus fulfilling the Prophetic vision of Swami Vivekananda. The Math runs on the same lines and on the same Motto, ‘Renunciation and Service’. <br><br> In August, 1959, Sri Sarada Math was given an independent legal status and the Sannyasinis became its Trustees by virtue of the Deed of Trust executed by the President of Ramakrishna Math, Belur (Deed No.4109 for the year 1959). In May, 1960, the Trustees of Sri Sarada Math, on the advice of the authorities of Belur Math, founded the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Association, which was registered under the Act XXI of 1860 (No.S/4008 for 1960-61), with the object of carrying out educational, medical, cultural, charitable and similar activities amongst the women and children looking upon them as veritable manifestations of the Divine. The Trustees of the Math are members of the Governing Body of the Mission.<br><br> Thus Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission, though legally and financially separate are basically one with the Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, being their counter parts. Since its inception many young girls from different parts of India and abroad, inspired by the ideal of Renunciation and Service have joined the Monastic Order for their own uplift and welfare of women at large.</p>
						<p>Today, Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission at Dakshineswar, Kolkata are conducting 35 Branch Centres in different parts of India including two abroad. Their multifarious activities may be classified as follows :</p>
