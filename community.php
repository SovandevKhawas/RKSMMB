							<br><br>
							One of the primary objectives of Matri Bhavan Hospital is to address the healthcare needs of communities that face barriers to accessing quality medical services due to factors such as geographical remoteness, economic constraints, or social marginalization.

The hospital covers the costs of investigations, treatments, surgeries, medications, and institutional care for such patients, ensuring that financial constraints do not hinder access to life-saving medical interventions.
							<br><br>
							In addition to its clinical services, Matri Bhavan also emphasizes the importance of holistic care, addressing the social determinants of health that impact the well-being of individuals and communities. Through partnerships with local organizations, government agencies, and non-profit groups, the hospital advocates for policies and programs that promote health equity and social justice.
